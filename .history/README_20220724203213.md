## Week 4 Project Starter for SWE2.0

This repository is basic boilerplate for an HTML site.  Also included in the model folder is a script containing an array of objects relating to Pokemon.  This can be used to help build out card decks for your Top Trump game.


### The Rules of the game

Both the player and the computer opponent are given decks of 15 cards.  For each round, before the player sees the computer's card, they must choose one category on their card that they think will outscore the computer.  Once they've selected and confirmed, the computer's card is overturned and a winner is chosen.  The winner gets to keep both cards and adds them to the back of their deck.  This continues until one player is all out of cards.
